Poor Sringeri Srinivas had too many bananas... 
He got to the town center, and went inside to speak with the head of the farmer's 
center. He negotiated a price and sold his bananas, then he received his money. When they
went back outside to his cart they found that the weird monkey had eaten all of his bananas. 
Sringeri took the money and ran.
