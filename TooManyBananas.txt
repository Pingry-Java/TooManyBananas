Poor Sringeri Srinivas had too many bananas... 
He got to the town center, and went inside to speak with the head of the farmer's 
center. He negotiated a price and sold his bananas, then he received his money. When they
went back outside to his cart they found that the weird monkey had eaten all of his bananas. 
Sringeri took the money and ran.

Returning to his village, Sringeri spent all the money he brought back from the town to create his own, state of the art banana harvester

Sringeri became rich, but soon the banana bubble burst, and he was in the same position he was at the beginning of his career.
