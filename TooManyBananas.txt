Poor Sringeri Srinivas had too many bananas... 
He got to the town center, and went inside to speak with the head of the farmer's 
center. He negotiated a price and sold his bananas, then he received his money. When they
went back outside to his cart they found that the weird monkey had eaten all of his bananas. 
Sringeri took the money and ran.

Returning to his village, Sringeri spent all the money he brought back from the town to 
create his own, state of the art banana harvester.

Sringeri became rich, but he was forced to spend much on bribe money to prevent the head 
of the farmer’s center from tracking him down. The only creature who ever found him was 
the weird monkey, who had an excellent sense of smell when it came to bananas and was 
able to sniff out Sringeri’s vast farm from miles away. Soon after acquiring his wealth, 
the banana bubble burst, and Sringeri was in the same position he was at the beginning of 
his career. 

However, he now had a bananas harvester. 
In spite of the low prices of bananas, Sringeri was able to produce many bananas. 
He eventually gathered an even larger cart of bananas, and was ready to bring it to a
different town’s farmer’s center. However, this time the weird monkey knew where he 
lived. While Sringeri was on his way to the town center, the weird monkey murdered him, 
took his clothes, and impersonated him. The monkey went to the town center, and the 
farmers, not suspecting anything, purchased half of its bananas. It brought the rest to 
it’s new home, where it gorged itself daily, and spent the rest of its days living a 
life of pure indulgence.
